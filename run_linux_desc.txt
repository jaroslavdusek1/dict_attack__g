differences from run.py:

vpn integration:

- after each password attempt, the script changes the vpn server to a new country. this is done by calling the change_vpn function, which uses nordvpn's command line interface to switch servers
- the script prints the current ip address to confirm that the vpn change was successful
- this process helps to distribute the login attempts across multiple ip addresses, reducing the risk of being blocked by instagram


vpn setup:

- for nordvpn users, make sure you are logged in, the script directly uses the nordvpn command to switch servers, if you are using a different vpn provider, you need to modify the change_vpn function
- the new vpn command should connect to a specified country and print the new ip address to the console, this ensures compatibility with various vpn services


captcha handling:

- the script checks for captcha by inspecting the current url after each login attempt
upon detecting a captcha, the script changes the vpn server and retries the password. this mechanism helps to bypass the captcha without manual intervention
